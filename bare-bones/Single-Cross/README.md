# Single-Cross

#### Question
> A random line segment of length D is chosen on a plane marked with an infinite checkerboard grid (i.e., a unit side length square grid).  What length D maximizes the probability that the segment crosses exactly one line on the checkerboard grid, and what is this maximal probability?
